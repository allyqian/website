abstract = "Objective: Adequate bowel preparation is important for colonoscopy. Currently available evidence on the determinants of poor bowel preparation is largely derived from studies in Western countries. We aimed to identify the risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy in the Chinese population. Methods: In this single-center study, patients admitted to the Outpatient Department between March 2013 and December 2015 and had indications for colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled. Questionnaires were administered to the patients. Their characteristics and procedure-related parameters such as procedure time were recorded. Bowel preparation was assessed using Boston bowel preparation scale score. Results: A total of 409 patients with a mean age of 48.865 Â± 6512.9 years were enrolled in the study, 60.9% of whom were men. On univariate analysis, poor educational level ( P =650.020), chronic constipation ( P =650.001), taking no physical exercise after medication. Conclusions: Chronic constipation, poor compliance with treatment and high-fiber diet were predictors of poor bowel preparation. Patients with these risk factors require more effective strategies for bowel preparation."
